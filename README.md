# RS-CORE

## Introduction
RS-CORE is a framework for the HELIX platform. The main goal of this framework is to make it as developer and user firendly as possible. To achieve this goal every commit to this repository is checked carefully for problems that might arise. This is also happening through simulation allowing to make sure that old features won't break by implementing new ones.

## Documentation
The documentation can be found in the wiki of this repository: [wiki](https://github.com/java3east/rs-core/wiki)

## Contribute
A framework is a big project and certainly nothing one can do on their own if they wan't to do it properly. If you have experience writing lua code feel free to add features that you would like to see in this framework or help us keeping this repository clean by taking a look at open pull requests and point out errors / problems that might arise from code that is about to be added to the framework, a second opinion never hurts!  
To ensure that new features don't lead to issues with old ones we are using a pipeline making use of the "RefineX" simulation program running automated tests and simulations.  
*Do not feel afraid to share your changes, even though you just stared learning LUA. Learning is a process and takes time, there will be no judgement, only constructive criticism.*
